# Game On! 

Game On! is a both a sample application, and throwback text adventure.

VERY MUCH a work in progress

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

### JavaScript client: 

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview (or view/edit JS and JavaScript live at the same time in WDT).

### Java application: 

Run live in WDR
Run `gradle build` to build the final server package for deployment.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

Gradle integration should mean running e2e tests for JS and Java app in one go (not there yet)


## TODO

[ ] OAuth2
[ ] Karma/Jasmine tests
[ ] Make sure build gradle runs the whole show and builds the final war in the right order



Mebbe
[ ] Maybe switch from grunt to gulp (see syntax behavior diffs)
